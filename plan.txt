    Design Concept: A large, open dome structure, using earthy, sustainable materials (wood, clay, and stone) to symbolize groundedness and inclusivity. Inside the dome, the SDGs should be displayed as murals, sculptures, or interactive elements that represent progress in poverty reduction, hunger, education, health, and gender equality.

    Elements:

 ----       SDG 1 (No Poverty): A small community scene, with people building homes or working together.

 ----       SDG 2 (Zero Hunger): An indoor vertical garden with crops growing or food-sharing scenes.

        SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being): A central wellness area with health symbols (stethoscopes, heart shapes, etc.).

        SDG 4 (Quality Education): Open books, desks, or a small classroom setup, possibly with children and teachers depicted.

        SDG 5 (Gender Equality): A large equality symbol (equal sign) or statues of men and women in different roles, standing together.

2. Dome 2: Planet – Protecting the Earth’s Ecosystems (SDGs 6, 12-15)

    Design Concept: A clean, eco-friendly dome structure with sustainable features like solar panels, plants, and water flowing through the space. Inside, you can create dynamic visual displays about clean water, responsible consumption, climate action, and life on land and below water.

    Elements:

        SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation): A small water fountain or river flowing through the dome.

        SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production): Recycling symbols, sustainable products, or interactive displays showing waste reduction.

        SDG 13 (Climate Action): A large globe or digital display showing climate data, or a mural depicting natural disasters and solutions.

        SDG 14 (Life Below Water): A display with aquatic plants and marine life sculptures, or a virtual aquarium with species from the ocean.

        SDG 15 (Life on Land): A forest or park-like setting with trees, wildlife, and plant life inside the dome, possibly with green walls or living plants.

3. Dome 3: Prosperity – Inclusive Growth and Innovation (SDGs 7-10)

    Design Concept: A modern, tech-inspired dome with clean lines and a sleek exterior. This dome could feature metallic textures, futuristic designs, and innovation-based displays, reflecting energy, economic growth, infrastructure, and reducing inequalities.

    Elements:

        SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy): Solar panels on the dome’s roof or wind turbines near the entrance.

        SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth): A small digital economy board or a simulated workspace with futuristic technology and collaboration.

        SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure): Sculptures or models representing infrastructure like bridges, factories, and tech innovations.

        SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities): A large, divided structure showing inequality on one side, with elements bridging the gap to represent inclusivity.

4. Dome 4: Peace – Justice and Strong Institutions (SDG 16)

    Design Concept: A grand, monumental dome with clean, formal design. The interior could reflect symbols of justice, peace, and rule of law, such as statues, the scales of justice, and images of collaboration across nations.

    Elements:

        SDG 16 (Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions): A large scale of justice statue at the center, surrounded by representations of peace (doves, olive branches), and a symbolic court of law.

        Interactive or static visuals: Digital projections showing peacebuilding efforts or UN resolutions, as well as images of peaceful protests and justice efforts worldwide.

5. Dome 5: Partnership – Global Solidarity (SDG 17)

    Design Concept: A large, interconnected globe-like structure or a network of interlocking pieces symbolizing the interconnectedness of global partnerships. This dome could be built with a series of interconnected arches or rings to symbolize global unity and collaboration.

    Elements:

        SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals): A large, glowing globe or a network of rings representing global partnerships.

        Interactive components: Digital screens showing real-time collaborations and partnerships across the world, or people working together on global goals.
